    "\n",
    "\"I'll keep the lot of you busy for a while\", the teacher said sternly to the group. \"You are to add the numbers from 1 to 100, and you are not to say a word until you are done.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The teacher expected a good period of quiet time, but a moment later our mathematician-to-be raised his hand with the answer. \"It's 5050!\" Gauss had realized that if you list all the numbers from 1 to 100, you can always match the first and last numbers in the list and get a common answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1, 2, 3, ..., 98, 99, 100\n",
    "    1 + 100 = 101\n",
    "    2 + 99 = 101\n",
    "    3 + 98 = 101\n",
    "\n",
    "Gauss realized there were exactly 50 pairs of numbers in the range 1 to 100, so he did a quick calculation: 50 * 101 = 5050.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Write a program that passes a list of numbers to a function.\n",
    "    - The function should use a while loop to keep popping the first and last numbers from the list and calculate the sum of those two numbers.\n",
    "    - The function should print out the current numbers that are being added, and print their partial sum.\n",
    "    - The function should keep track of how many partial sums there are.\n",
    "    - The function should then print out how many partial sums there were.\n",
    "    - The function should perform Gauss' multiplication, and report the final answer.\n",
    "- Prove that your function works, by passing in the range 1-100, and verifying that you get 5050.\n",
    "    - `gauss_addition(list(range(1,101)))`\n",
    "- Your function should work for any set of consecutive numbers, as long as that set has an even length.\n",
